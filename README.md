# My ZMK keymap

Default readme from the template: [README from template.md](./README from template.md)

## Basic Alpha and Symbol layout: NEO2
The basis for the layout is the [neo2 layout](https://www.neo-layout.org/)

## Thumbcluser usage
### Single key actions

There these 4 actions:

| Combination | Action |
| ----------|----------|
| X _ $~~$ _ _ | Navigation & Numpad   |
| _ X $~~$ _ _ | Window management    |
| _ _ $~~$ X _ | Symbols    |
| _ _ $~~$ _ X | Space bar    |

### Dual key actions (held in sequence)

There are these 8 where both keys are on opposite hands. Note that the order in wich the keys are pressed is important!

| Combination |Primary Layer | Action |
| ----------|----------|----------|
| 1 _ $~~$ 2 _ | Navigation & Numpad | **unassigned**    |
| 1 _ $~~$ _ 2 | Navigation & Numpad | *unavailable¹*    |
| _ 1 $~~$ 2 _ | Window management | Fancy Zones    |
| _ 1 $~~$ _ 2 | Window management | **unassigned**    |
| 2 _ $~~$ 1 _ | Symbols | greek layer     |
| _ 2 $~~$ 1 _ | Symbols |  Keyboard management  |
| 2 _ $~~$ _ 1 | Space bar | *unavailable²*    |
| _ 2 $~~$ _ 1 | Space bar | *unavailable²*    |

¹ Numpad 0 is on the thumb cluster <br>
² First key is actually the spacebar

=> I have 4 viable combinations available.

These combinations are quite easy to press and leaves digits 2-5 free for typing. It would be a good idea to use them for layer switching instead of single key presses
